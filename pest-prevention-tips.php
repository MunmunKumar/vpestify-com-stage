                            <p>Seal up the house – all cracks, windows, floors and doors</p>
                            <p>Regularly check roofing and walls for any signs of decay – anything that could become a potential home for pests</p>
                            <p>Mow lawns and trim plants regularly</p>
                            <p>Avoid any build-up of clutter both inside and outside the home – keep a good distance between any wood piles, compost bins, etc. and your home</p>
                            <p><b>Learning and adhering to these simple tasks should save you from irritating infestations in your home. So share these neat tips – not tricks!</b></p>
